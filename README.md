# Assignment 3: Employee Payroll Tracker

## Goal

The goal of this project is to use starter code to create an application that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data.

Success is outlined through the portfolio containing the following:

- When clicking the "Add employee" button will prompt user for an employee's first name, last name, and salary
- After inputting one employee, the user will be prompted to continue adding employees or cancel
- Employee data that was inputted is displayed after cancel
- The console log shows the salary average of all the employees
- The console log shows a random employee


## Mock-Up

The following images show the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Known Issues

These are known issues to refactor later

- Input windows show up on load, instead of on click
- Employee name is not displaying after cancel
- Adding the sum of all the employees is broken.
- Fetching a random employee is broken
